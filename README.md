# Challenge2-ProfessionalPortfolio

## Description

My motivation for this proejct was to build a portfolio showcasing my work as a web developer and tie in my background in media production as this page reflects.  In this professional portfolio, I would like to put my greatest works on display for future employers, once I complete these works and the UCLA Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp.  Each section will link to a deployed project.  This solves the problem of not having a central repository to display my work as I apply my new skills in web development to creating web projects.  Throughout this project, I learned to build a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.  I have applied the style tools in CSS such as flexboxes and media queries.  


## Installation
N/A


## Usage

At the top of this website there is a navigation bar with links that, when clicked will scroll down to its corresponding section.  Likns to the section of "my work" will take you to the title images of my current works. When you hover over the image a transition has been applied so the user can see that the image is clickable.  Once clicked on, a new tab will pop up taking them to the deployed project's website.  Media queries have also been applied for the different screen sizes of desktop, tablet, and mobile.  This allows the user to view this website at various screen sizes.  


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:


   ```md
   ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
   ```
